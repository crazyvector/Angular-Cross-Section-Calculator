To convert raw files, additional programs (`convert.cpp` and `faster2spectra.cpp`) are required but not included in this repository.  

To run the conversion, copy the program into the desired folder and execute `./conversie.sh` there.  

To run this batch file, the program `convert.cpp` must be globally available as `convert_inelastic`, and `faster2spectra.cpp` should also be globally available as `faster2spectra`. If not, it is possible to edit `conversie.sh` and specify the relative path of the programs.
